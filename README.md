# AI_For_CallCenter

We will try to explore, how AI can assist with simplifying the experience of customers and call center representatives. We will increase the complexity incrementally.

As part of Part_1: We will create a chat assistant that can take user question --> convert the request to a query --> execute the query in database --> get the response from database --> Provide response to user in Natural Language.
The code of Part_1 is in the folder Part-1_AI_For_CSR

As part of Part_2: We will enhance the capabilities of CSR representatives by introducing AI Agents. The Agent will access various services via Tools, also we will have the policy documents ingested into RAG. The code for creating and running mock services, along with bringing up the AI Agent for accessing these services is in the folder Part-2_AI_For_CSR_AIAgents
